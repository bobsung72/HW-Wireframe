<div id="aboutme">
    <p>I like long walks in the park and sunsets by the beach.  Golf in the mornings with a strong bloody mary.
        Born in Taiwan and moved to the States when I was 8yr old.  Youngest out of two siblings and the quiet
        one in the family.  Not the sharpest knife in the cutlery but definitely the toughest.  My life motto is 
        "Either you're evolving and growing or you're not living your life to it's full potential."
